The purpose of this engine is to prove that Anti-Line4 is a second-player win.
Anti-Line 4 is played with the rules known from Brainking and Zillions of games:
1. A player is not allowed to move on a column where his opponent has moved in his last turn
2. If the board is full and no player has 4 pieces in a row, the first player wins.

Although the search of FSF is imposant, it needs about 6 moves before it shows a decisive advantage for the second player.
For better fixing this insight in the first moves, the engine may get in future a NNUE
